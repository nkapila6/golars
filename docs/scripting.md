# golars scripting language (`.glr`)

`.glr` files are a tiny, line-oriented language for pipeline-style
DataFrame work. Designed to feel like "your REPL session in a file",
nothing more. Every REPL command you know is also a script statement.

```glr
# trades-daily.glr
load data/trades.csv          as trades
load data/symbols.csv         as symbols

use trades
filter volume > 100
groupby symbol amount:sum:total
join symbols on symbol
sort total desc
limit 10
show
```

Run it:

```sh
golars run trades-daily.glr       # one-shot
```

From inside the REPL:

```
golars » .source trades-daily.glr
```

## Grammar

```ebnf
program      = { statement NL } ;
statement    = empty
             | comment
             | command ;
comment      = "#" { any-char-until-NL } ;
command      = [ "." ] identifier { arg } ;
arg          = identifier | number | string | operator | "as" | "on" ;
string       = '"' { any-char } '"' ;
identifier   = ( letter | "_" ) { letter | digit | "_" | "." | "-" | "/" | ":" } ;
number       = [ "-" ] digit { digit } [ "." digit { digit } ] ;
operator     = "==" | "!=" | "<=" | ">=" | "<" | ">" | "and" | "or" ;
```

Statements are line-terminated. A trailing `\` (after any trailing
whitespace) continues onto the next physical line, useful for long
filter predicates:

```glr
filter salary > 100000 \
  and dept == "eng" \
  and tenure_years >= 2
```

The leading `.` on every command is optional: `load foo.csv` and
`.load foo.csv` do the same thing. A `#` inside a `"..."` string is
treated as a literal - only unquoted `#` starts a comment.

If you mis-spell a command golars tries to be helpful:

```
$ golars run typo.glr
typo.glr:3: unknown script command .filtet (did you mean `.filter`?)
```

## Statement reference

| Statement | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| `load PATH`                            | Focus a new frame (csv/tsv/parquet/ipc/arrow). |
| `load PATH as NAME`                    | Stage a frame under `NAME` without touching focus. |
| `use NAME`                             | Switch focus to a clone of `NAME`. `NAME` stays staged so repeated `use` branches off the same base; prior focus is discarded. |
| `stash NAME`                           | Materialize the focus and save it under `NAME`; focus continues with the snapshot. |
| `frames`                               | List loaded frames. The focused one is marked `*`. |
| `drop_frame NAME`                      | Release `NAME` from the registry. |
| `save PATH`                            | Materialize the focused pipeline and write to disk. |
| `select COL [, COL...]`                | Project columns (lazy). |

### String operations

String-column ops are reachable via `col(x).str.<op>()` on the expression
API, and inside `.filter` via keyword operators that desugar to the same
Exprs. Every op below is backed by the series kernel of the same name; the
expression layer is a thin dispatch on the function name.

| Filter keyword | Expr method | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| `contains "sub"` | `col(x).str.contains("sub")` | Literal substring, no regex |
| `starts_with "p"` | `col(x).str.starts_with("p")` | Byte-prefix |
| `ends_with "s"` | `col(x).str.ends_with("s")` | Byte-suffix |
| `like "%pat%"` | `col(x).str.like("%pat%")` | SQL wildcards: `%` any, `_` one, `\\` escape |
| `not_like "%pat%"` | `col(x).str.not_like("%pat%")` | Negation fused into the kernel |

Non-predicate string ops available on Expr (no filter-grammar sugar, used
via `.select`, `.with_column`, or in aggregations):

`str.to_lower`, `str.to_upper`, `str.trim`, `str.strip_prefix(p)`,
`str.strip_suffix(s)`, `str.replace(o, n)`, `str.replace_all(o, n)`,
`str.len_bytes`, `str.len_chars`, `str.count_matches(s)`, `str.find(s)`,
`str.head(n)`, `str.tail(n)`, `str.slice(start, length)`,
`str.contains_regex(pat)`.

### Predicate grammar

For `filter`:

```
col op value [and|or col op value]...
```

- No parentheses, left-to-right evaluation.
- Ops: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `is_null`, `is_not_null`.
- Values: integers, floats, double-quoted strings, `true`, `false`.

Examples:

```glr
filter age >= 21 and salary > 50000
filter symbol == "AAPL"
filter is_active and created_at > 1704067200000000
filter note is_null
```

## Multi-source workflows

Scripts regularly need N frames. The `as NAME` / `use NAME` /
`.frames` trio is the whole story: there's no hidden namespace:

```glr
# Stage every input up front. None of these promote themselves to
# focus, so we can read them in any order.
load data/trades.csv    as trades
load data/symbols.csv   as symbols
load data/users.csv     as users

# Work on one, stash it, work on the next.
use trades
filter volume > 100
groupby user_id amount:sum:total_bought
stash trade_totals

# `use` is non-consuming: trade_totals stays staged, and so does the
# original trades frame: we could `use trades` again to branch off a
# different filter.
use users
filter region == "US"
join trade_totals on user_id
join symbols on symbol
sort total_bought desc
show
```

`stash` is the "save into a variable" move: it materializes whatever
lazy pipeline is on the focus and parks a copy under `NAME` so later
`use NAME` gives you that snapshot. The focus itself keeps going
from the snapshot, so the idiomatic branching pattern is:

```glr
load data/trades.csv
filter volume > 100
stash base

filter side == "buy"
stash buys

use base
filter side == "sell"
stash sells

use buys
join sells on symbol
```

When `.join` sees a name that exists in the frame registry, it
consumes that frame (keeping it in the registry for reuse) instead
of treating the argument as a path. Paths win only when no frame
matches.

### Anonymous `load PATH`

The short form `load PATH` (no `as`) is equivalent to `use NAME`
where `NAME` is empty. It's the "single-frame script" ergonomic:

```glr
load data/trades.csv
filter volume > 100
show
```

No registry, no juggling: just pipe.

## Interop with code

Anything that implements `script.Executor` can host the language.
`cmd/golars` is the reference, but the package ships a generic
runner:

```go
import "github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/golars/script"

r := script.Runner{
    Exec:  script.ExecutorFunc(func(line string) error { /* … */ return nil }),
    Trace: func(line string) { fmt.Println(">", line) },
    ContinueOnErr: true,
    ErrOut: os.Stderr,
}
if err := r.RunFile("pipeline.glr"); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

- `Trace` receives every normalised statement just before execution.
- `ContinueOnErr` + `ErrOut` emits errors inline and keeps running.
- `script.Normalize(raw)` is exported so third parties can apply the
  same parsing rules (comment stripping, leading `.` insertion).

## Editor support

Tree-sitter grammar + highlight queries live at
[`editors/tree-sitter-golars/`](../editors/tree-sitter-golars/).
Install notes for Neovim (`nvim-treesitter`) and VS Code in that
directory's README.

### LSP

<p align="center"><img src="../golars_lsp.png" alt="golars-lsp in Neovim: inlay hints showing frame shape after every .glr statement" width="360"></p>

[`cmd/golars-lsp`](../cmd/golars-lsp/) is a minimal Language Server
that ships:

- **Inline completions** for commands, staged-frame names, file
  paths, and column names read from loaded CSV files.
- **Inlay hints** showing each pipeline step's output shape -
  `→ 5 rows × 3 cols` appears at the end of every shape-changing
  statement. Row counts propagate as upper bounds: `limit N` clamps
  to `N`, left joins preserve the left side's count, filters and
  inner joins mark rows `?`.
- **Hover docs** with signature + long description on any command
  token.
- **Diagnostics** for unknown commands and files that don't resolve.

### `# ^?` probe: live table previews

Drop `# ^?` on its own line anywhere in a script and the Neovim
plugin renders the focused frame's current table as virtual text
below the comment (via a `golars --preview` subprocess). This is the
scripting equivalent of Twoslash/Quokka probes: a live peek at the
data at that pipeline position:

```glr
load data/trades.csv
filter volume > 100
sort amount desc
limit 5
# ^?
```

The preview updates on save + debounced text changes; configure via
`require("golars").setup({ preview_cmd = { "/path/to/golars" },
preview_rows = 20, preview_timeout_ms = 3000 })`. Set `preview = false`
to disable.

### `golars --preview <path>`

Invoke the preview pipeline from any editor, or manually via:

```sh
golars --preview path/to/script.glr
golars --preview path/to/script.glr --preview-rows 25
```

Runs the script silently (no banner, no trace, no success chrome)
and prints exactly one rendered table: the focused pipeline's head.
Exit code 0 on success, non-zero on script error (message on stderr).

---

## What this language is NOT

- No variables beyond the named-frame registry. If you need
  branching or reusable expressions, write a Go program that
  drives `script.Runner` with your own logic.
- No control flow (no `if`, no loops). The idiom for conditional
  runs is shell scripting around `golars run`, or a Go host with
  an `Executor` that dispatches.
- No expression language beyond the filter predicate DSL and
  groupby agg spec. Polars-style `pl.col("a") + pl.col("b")` is a
  `cmd/golars` feature we might add later, but the base language
  stays small.

The design target is "drop a day of REPL work into a file and have
it run again tomorrow." Everything else is out of scope.
