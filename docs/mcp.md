# MCP: golars as a tool for your LLM host

`golars-mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server that exposes a
read-only subset of golars as tools an LLM host can invoke. Works
with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any other MCP-aware
client.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/golars/cmd/golars-mcp@latest
```

The binary lives in `$GOBIN` (or `$HOME/go/bin` by default).

## Configure Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows; the
Linux equivalent lives under `~/.config/Claude/`) and add a
`mcpServers` entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "golars": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/golars-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the Claude Desktop app. You should see a hammer icon in the
conversation pane letting you enable the `golars` server.

## Configure Cursor / Windsurf

Both editors read the same JSON format. Add the same snippet to
your workspace MCP config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor). No
restart needed in Cursor; the server picks up automatically.

## Available tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `schema` | Return column names + dtypes for a data file |
| `head` | Return the first N rows (CSV/Parquet/Arrow/JSON/NDJSON) |
| `describe` | Return describe()-style summary stats |
| `sql` | Run a SQL query against one or more files |
| `row_count` | Cheap "how many rows × cols" probe |
| `null_counts` | Per-column null counts |

Every tool returns _both_ a plain-text fallback (for hosts that only
render text) and a `structuredContent` payload with `columns` +
`rows` arrays so richer UIs can render a table.

## Example session

After configuring the server, ask your LLM host something like:

> "What's the schema of `~/data/trades.csv`? If any column has more
> than 10% nulls, summarise it with describe."

The host picks up the tool catalogue from `tools/list`, calls
`schema` then `null_counts` then `describe`, and the model answers
using the structured results.

## Protocol notes

- Protocol version: `2025-06-18`. We only implement the tools
  capability; resources and prompts are not served (yet).
- Transport: stdio JSON-RPC 2.0, one object per line.
- No authentication: `golars-mcp` reads files the user running the
  host process has read access to.

## Security

The MCP server is **read-only**. It cannot write files, start
subprocesses, or reach the network. The tools only accept a path
string and execute a query against its contents; SQL is compiled to
a lazy plan with a whitelist of operators (no arbitrary expressions
or DDL). That said, it _will_ read any file the caller names :
don't point a host LLM at secrets.

## Extending

`cmd/golars-mcp/tools.go` registers tools into a flat slice. Add a
new `Tool{Name, Description, InputSchema, Run}` entry and the
server picks it up. Keep tools pure (no state outside the local
session) so concurrent calls are safe.
